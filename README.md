# Resilience-Analysis-of-Graphs
This is a study of resilience in social networks, the comparative approach using two specific datasets, and the exploration of the impact of edge deletions on the overall structure of the graphs.
The provided R code is primarily concerned with graph analysis and manipulation, focusing on the "karate" and "kite" datasets. In the first part of the code (Parts A and B), the igraph and igraphdata libraries are loaded to work with these datasets. The code calculates the number of edges to be removed, which is 5% of the total edges, and randomly deletes them from the graphs. The modified graphs are then plotted, and a hierarchical random graph (HRG) model is fitted using the statnet library. This process is performed on both the "karate" and "kite" datasets, allowing for a comparative analysis.

In the latter part of the code (Parts C and D), the process is extended to explore the effects of deleting larger percentages of edges, specifically 10% and 20%. The edges are randomly selected and deleted from the graphs, and the modified graphs are plotted. Subsequently, HRG models are fitted to these graphs. The systematic deletion of different percentages of edges and the fitting of models to the resulting graphs suggest an exploration into the robustness or vulnerability of these networks to random edge deletions. This approach helps in understanding how changes in connectivity impact the overall structure of the graphs.
